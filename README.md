# SQL--Project-Querying-a-Large-Relational-Database

In this project, I successfully queried the AdventureWorks sample database to extract key customer and sales information using SQL. 
I focused on various SQL operators and functions to analyze customer details, monthly sales trends, and overall sales performance.

Achievements
Database Restoration: I downloaded the AdventureWorks2012.bak file from GitHub and restored it in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), making the database ready for querying.

Data Analysis: 
I wrote and executed SQL queries to retrieve:
-Customer details including email, phone numbers, and related information.
-Sales data for specific months, including total sales
-SQL Proficiency: I utilized SQL functions such as SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, and aggregation functions (SUM) to extract meaningful insights from the database.

Skills Gained
SQL Querying: Mastered advanced querying techniques for filtering, joining, and aggregating data across multiple tables.
Sales Data Analysis: Analyzed and reported on sales performance by month and individual customers.
